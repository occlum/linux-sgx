The ippcp library is built based on the Open Source project ipp-crypto:
   https://github.com/intel/ipp-crypto/
   branch: ipp-crypto_2019_update5

In order to build your own IPP crypto, please follow below steps:
1. Read the ipp-crypto README to prepare your build environment.
2. Make sure ipp-crypto source code are prepared.
3. Build the target ippcp library with the prepared Makefile:
   a. Build the target ippcp library with All-Loads-Mitigation:
      $ make MITIGATION-CVE-2020-0551=LOAD
   b. Build the target ippcp library with Branch-Mitigation:
      $ make MITIGATION-CVE-2020-0551=CF
   c. Build the target ippcp library with No-Mitigation:
      $ make
The built-out static library `libippcp.a` and header files will be copied into the right place.
Remember to "make clean" before switching the build.

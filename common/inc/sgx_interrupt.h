// An interrupt mechanism for dynamically-loaded workloads in enclaves.
//
// Workloads in an enclave can be classified into two categories: statically-loaded and
// dynamically-loaded workloads. Statically-loaded workloads are application code that
// are built into the enclave; that is, they are part of the enclave since enclave initialization.
// Dynamically-loaded workloads, as the name suggests, are application code loaded after
// the enclave gets running.
//
// One typical example of dynamically-loaded workloads is user programs loaded by a SGX
// LibOS. The user programs could be arbitrary code. As a result, once the user program
// gets executed, the LibOS may never have the opportunity to take control of the CPU.
// Without the ability to regain the control, it is impossible for the LibOS to implement
// features like interruptible signal handler or preemptive in-enclave thread scheduling.
//
// To address the issue above, we implement the signal-based interrupt mechanism for
// dynamically-loaded workloads. With the provided APIs, the users can now interrupt the
// dynamically-loaded workloads executed in a SGX thread by simply sending a real-time
// POSIX signal (whosenumber is 64, the max value of signal numbers on Linux) to the SGX
// thread. The signal will be captured and (if the timing is good) a pre-registered
// interrupt handler will get executed inside the enclave.
//
// Note that the interrupt mechanism only performs the signal-to-interrupt conversion
// described above is in a best-effort manner. That is, sending a signal may not
// result in the interrupt handler getting called. For example, if the target SGX thread is
// executing some code outside the enclave, then the signal received will be simply
// ignored, thus not triggering the interrupt handler to be executed. So the users of
// the interrupt mechanism should find other means to determine if an interrupt has been
// delivered, and if not, whether and when to resend the interrupt (via POSIX signal).
